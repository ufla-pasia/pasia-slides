## Example slide

### This is a subtitle

Before we dive a bit deeper, here is a simple example of the
[clean theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean)
in action. 

- No pictures or anything fancy. Just text for the moment.

Next, we'll take a brief tour of some theme components.

- We'll use the same basic
structure as the
[original LaTeX slides](https://raw.githack.com/kylebutts/templates/master/latex-slides/auxiliary/slides.pdf).
- Note that the [_full suite_](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)
of Reveal.js features are available for this Quarto implementation,
even if we don't cover everything here.


## Before you proceed...

### Requirements for the coding examples in this demo

:::{.callout-note}
## R libraries

While the clean theme is language agnostic, we will use several R coding
examples in this demo to highlight some advanced theme features.

You will need the following libraries if you'd like to render the template
"as-is":

```{.r}
install.packages(c("modelsummary", "gt", "fixest", "pdftools", "tinytex", "threejs"))
```
:::


:::{.callout-note}
## TinyTex

While reveal.js presentations are HTML format, we will show an example of how to 
embed LaTeX tables as images. This requires a working Tex distribution, of which
TinyTex provides by far the easiest and lightest integration with Quarto. More
details [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html).

```{.bash}
quarto install tinytex
```

## Components

### Ordered and Unordered Lists

Here we have an unordered list.

- first item
    - sub-item
- second item

And next we have an ordered one.

1. first item
    i) sub-item
2. second item

## Components

### Alerts & Cross-refs {#sec-crossref}

To emphasize specific words or text, you can:

- Use the default `.alert` class, e.g. [important note]{.alert}.
- Use the `.fg` class for custom colour, e.g. [important note]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}.
- Use the `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}.

To cross-reference, you have several options, for example:

- Beamer-like `.button` class provided by this theme, e.g. [[Appendix]{.button}](#sec-appendix)
- Quarto's native cross-ref syntax, e.g., "See @sec-appendix."

## Components

### Citations

Citations follow the standard
[Quarto format](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#citations)
and be sourced from BibLaTex, BibTeX, or CLS files. For example:

 - [Topic 1:]{.alert} Spatial Frictions [@Fajgelbaum_Morales_Serrato_Zidar_2018; @Hsieh_Moretti_2019; @Moretti_2011]

- [Topic 2:]{.alert} Blah [@Su√°rez_Serrato_Zidar_2016]

## Components

### Blocks

Quarto provides
[dedicated environments](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs)
for theorems, lemmas, and so forth. 

But in presentation format, it's arguably more effective just to use a
[Callout Block](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).

:::{.callout-note}
## Regression Specification

The main specification is as follows:

$$
y_{it} = X_{it} \beta + \mu_i + \varepsilon_{it}
$$
:::

## Components

### Multicolumn I: Text only

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Column 1

Here is a long sentence that will wrap onto the next line as it hits the column
width, and continue this way until it stops.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Column 2

Some other text in another column.

A second paragraph.
:::

::::

Multicolumn support is very flexible and we can continue with a single full
span column in the same slide.

## Components

### Multicolumn II: Text and figures

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/kanagawa.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- A point about the figure that is potentially important.
- Another point about the figure that is also potentially important.
:::

::::

Note that sub- and multi-panel figures are also natively supported by Quarto.
See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#subfigures).

## Components

# Tables {background-color="#40666e"}

## Tables

### Regression example

Quarto offers excellent
[table support](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html),
with further customization via user libraries. Let's illustrate with a
regression example:

## Regression table

### modelsummary

If you use `modelsummary` with this Quarto theme, we advise setting the `gt`
backend for a cleaner aesthetic. More details
[here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/appearance.html).

## Regression table

### etable

`fixest`'s powerful native tabling functions were designed for LaTeX output. But we
can use the `markdown = TRUE` option to make them work with this theme too. 
(Details
[here](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/articles/etable_new_features.html).) Quick notes:

 - Install the `tinytex` & `pdftools` packages first.
 - Set the R chunk option `output: asis`.

# Figures {background-color="#40666e"}

## Figure

![](images/kanagawa.jpg)

## Figure

### Full-size Figures

You can use the `{.background-image}` container environment to completely fill
the slide background with an image.

Ideally, your figure will be the same aspect ratio as the screen that you're presenting on.

- This can be a bit tricky because of the dynamic nature of reveal.js / HTML. But it's probably something close to 16:9.
- Aspect ratio can also matter for a regular full-frame images (previous slide).

## {background-image="images/kanagawa169.jpg" background-size="100%"}

## Interactive plots

_Note: Simple flight data example using `threejs`. There are many interactive
plotting options beyond this.
(More [details](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/).)_

# Summary {background-color="#40666e"}

## Summary

### A minimal and elegant presentation theme


The Quarto reveal.js [clean theme](grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean) aims to
be a minimal and elegant presention theme.

We have highlighted some theme-specific components. But all of the regular reveal.js functionality is supported ([chalkboard](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#chalkboard), etc.)

Install the theme:

```{.bash}
quarto install extension grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean
```

Use these demo slides as a template:

```{.bash}
quarto use template grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo
```
